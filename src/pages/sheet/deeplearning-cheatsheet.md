## Synopsis

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.

### Architecture

In a neural network, the nodes are organized in layers. An input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the output of a node. Without activation functions, neural networks would be equivalent to a single-layer perceptron, which can only learn linear functions.

The most common activation functions are:

### Regularization

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting. Overfitting is when the neural network model fits the training data too well. The model is too complex and does not generalize well to new data.

The most common regularization techniques are:
