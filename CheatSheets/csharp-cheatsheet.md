# C# for Developers

C Sharp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

| byte      | Unsigned integer                | 1 byte   |
| char      | Character                       | 2 bytes  |
| decimal   | Decimal data type               | 16 bytes |
| double    | Double-precision floating point | 8 bytes  |
| float     | Single-precision floating point | 4 bytes  |
| int       | Integer                         | 4 bytes  |
| long      | Long integer                    | 8 bytes  |
| sbyte     | Signed integer                  | 1 byte   |
| short     | Short integer                   | 2 bytes  |

## Collections
Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects. Unlike arrays, the group of objects you work with can grow and shrink dynamically as the needs of the application change. For some collections, you can assign a key to any object that you put into the collection so that you can quickly retrieve the object by using the key.

```csharp
var exampleStringList = new List<string>();   // To create and initialize a list of strings

var exampleDictionary = new Dictionary<string,string>();   // To create and initialize a dictionary which holds the key as a string and value as a string

var exampleHashset = new HashSet<int>(); // To create and initialize a HashSet of integers

var exampleArraylist = new ArrayList(); // To create and initialize an ArrayList object

var exampleHashtable = new Hashtable(); // To create and initialize a hashtable

var exampleSortedList = new SortedList<int,string>(); // To create and initialize a SortedList
```

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

```csharp
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)

double myFloatNum = 5.99D;   // Floating point number

char myLetter = 'D';         // Character

string myText = "Hello";     // String

bool myBool = true;          // Boolean
```

## Operators

| Operator | Description    | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| +        | Addition       | x + y   |
| -        | Subtraction    | x - y   |
| \*       | Multiplication | x \* y  |
| /        | Division       | x / y   |
| %        | Modulus        | x % y   |
| ++       | Increment      | ++x     |
| --       | Decrement      | --x     |

## Loops

### For Loop

```csharp
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### While Loop

```csharp
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Do While Loop

```csharp
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```

### For Each Loop

```csharp
foreach (type variableName in arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

### Break

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

### Continue

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    continue;
  }
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```
